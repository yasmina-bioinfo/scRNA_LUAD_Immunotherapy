**Integrated single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analysis of immune T cell states associated with immunotherapy response in lung cancer**

---

## Project highlights

- Integrated **single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analysis** of the tumor microenvironment in NSCLC patients treated with immunotherapy (GSE207422).
- Identification of **T cell functional states** associated with clinical response (PR vs SD), with responders enriched in cytotoxic CD8-like programs accompanied by activation-associated immune regulatory markers, and non-responders enriched in naive/memory CD4-like states.
- Consistent immune polarization observed across cellular (scRNA-seq) and tissue-level (bulk RNA-seq) analyses using shared gene signatures.
- Analysis emphasizes biological interpretation, traceability, and methodological clarity, positioning transcriptomics as a tool to support biological interpretation of immune mechanisms.

## Project rationale

This project explores how **immune cell states**, and in particular **T cell functional programs**, differ between lung cancer patients who respond to immune checkpoint blockade and those who do not.

Using a combination of **single-cell RNA-seq** and **bulk RNA-seq**, the analysis aims to identify transcriptional patterns associated with **clinical response (RECIST PR vs SD)** and to assess the consistency of these patterns across transcriptomic scales.

The project is designed as a **learning-driven but biologically grounded analysis**, emphasizing interpretation, methodological transparency, and cross-validation rather than model building.

## Dataset and source study

All data derive from the GEO dataset **GSE207422**, generated in the following study:

**Hu J, Zhang L, Xia H, et al.**  
*Tumor microenvironment remodeling after neoadjuvant immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing.*  
**Genome Medicine**. 2023;15(1):14.  
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36869384/

The dataset includes:
- single-cell RNA-seq (UMI counts) from tumor microenvironment cells,
- bulk RNA-seq expression data (log2 TPM),
- clinical annotations including RECIST response categories.

Analyses were restricted to **partial responders (PR)** and **stable disease (SD)** samples to ensure consistency across modalities.

## Analysis overview

### Single-cell RNA-seq (NB01–NB02)
- Quality control, normalization, and unsupervised clustering
- Integration of clinical metadata (RECIST)
- Automated cluster annotation based on marker enrichment
- Focused analysis of the **T cell compartment**
- Scoring of functional programs:
  - Naive/Memory
  - Cytotoxic
  - Checkpoint/Exhaustion
- Intra–T cell zoom:
  - Cytotoxic vs naive/memory states
  - CD8-like vs CD4-like transcriptional programs
- Validation of cytotoxic programs using a cytotoxic-like T cell subset as a supporting analysis (NB04).

### Bulk RNA-seq (NB03)
- Use of the **same immune gene signatures** as in the single-cell analysis
- Computation of signature scores per sample
- PR vs SD comparison at the tissue level
- Visualization using summary plots
- Cross-validation of single-cell observations

---

## Key findings

- **PR samples** are enriched in **cytotoxic, CD8-like T cell programs**, consistent with effective antitumor immune engagement.
- **SD samples** show predominance of **naive/memory and CD4-like T cell states**, suggesting a less activated immune profile.
- Checkpoint/exhaustion-associated gene programs are detectable in both groups and are interpreted as **activation-associated regulatory signals**, rather than evidence of terminal T cell exhaustion.
- Bulk RNA-seq analyses recapitulate the same immune polarization observed at single-cell resolution.

## Interpretation

The convergence between single-cell and bulk RNA-seq results supports the robustness of the identified immune signatures.  
This project illustrates how **functional immune states**, rather than cell types alone, are associated with differential clinical response to immunotherapy.

The analysis emphasizes **biological interpretation and methodological clarity**, and is intended as a foundation for more mechanistic or hypothesis-driven studies.

## Notes for reviewers

**Data availability:**  
Raw and processed expression matrices are not included in this repository due to size constraints. All analyses were performed on publicly available data from GEO (GSE207422).

- All annotations are **probabilistic and data-driven**, not hard labels.
- No pseudobulk aggregation was used in the single-cell analysis.
- Gene signatures were deliberately reused across scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq to ensure biological consistency.
- The project prioritizes **interpretability and reasoning** over predictive modeling.
